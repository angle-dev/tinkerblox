			There used to be a time when the spaces we lived in, travelled in, worked in and played in,
			were only that – spaces.  Interactions, if any, were limited, unidirectional and mostly,
			boring. <br /> <br /> With digital technologies becoming mainstream, this has changed
			drastically. Today, it’s not unimaginable for homes to interact with its inhabitants, for
			offices to proactively care for the environment of its workers, for factories to take
			responsibility of the safety & security of its men & machines, for greenhouses to adapt to the
			needs of its plant life, and for all of the above to be conscious of their role in creating a
			sustainable and eco-friendly environment <br /> <br />

				@TinkerBloX, we believe in creating SAFE – Sustainable, Autonomous, Federated, Efficient –
